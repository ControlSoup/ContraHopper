# ContraHopper
The ContraHopper is a small rotor craft using two counter rotating propellers and jet vanes to maintain attitude and altitude. This project is a personal project with unnecessary constraints to mimic the control of VTVL rockets. Documentation up to date and not final, poor grammar will presist.
