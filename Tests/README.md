# ContraHopper
The ContraHopper is a small rotor craft using two counter rotating propellers and jet vanes to maintain attitude and altitude. This project is a personal project with unnecessary constraints to mimic the control of VTVL rockets. 

This repository is not intended for collaborative use at this time.

## Folder Structure
Each folder acts as a container for a part of the project, these will eventually hold all files that I used to design an operate ContraHopper for better or for worse. Currently every folder is a work in progress, many contain their own README.md with an overview a list of TO-DOs.
